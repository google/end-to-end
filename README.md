End-To-End

![Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/google/end-to-end.svg "End to End Travis Build")

End-To-End is a Chrome extension that helps you encrypt, decrypt, digitally sign, and verify signed messages within the browser using OpenPGP.

This is the source code for the alpha release of the End-To-End Chrome extension. It's built upon a newly developed, JavaScript-based crypto library. End-To-End implements the OpenPGP standard, IETF RFC 4880, enabling key generation, encryption, decryption, digital signature, and signature verification. We’re releasing this code to enable community review; it is not yet ready for general use.
